# Custom Event Monitoring

this is an devtools extention that let's you monitor events that you dispatch by ```document.dispatchEvent```

in main page you can add your listener events. f.e you want to dispatch an event like this:
```
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('KEY_A', {
  detail: {
    name: 'some data'
  }
}));
```
you should add ```KEY_A``` and hit confirm.
